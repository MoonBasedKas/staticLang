# Static void techincal specification

Static void is a game that relies upon an interpretor to decide how to perform. 
The game provides two different interfaces to this interpretor:
- Text based written in static script.
- Visual based in static block.

#StaticLang 
Static void uses a language called StaticLang this name may be changed later but 
is a custom built language that runs on the SLI: StaticLang Interpretor. All it really 
needs is a tokenizer and be fed those tokens and static lang will execute those tokens.
